A gag script that displays a random image out of a selection of images.

Setup
=====
For a basic setup, simply copy over the files in this repository onto some webspace somewhere and then add images to the images folder. In the default configuration, this app will automatically recognize any images in the images folder and add them to the list of images to be randomly chosen from.

If your images are in a substantially different place than the rest of the application files, delete the images folder and then edit the `$image_prefix` variable in `index.php` accordingly.

Configuration
=============
The app as a number of other configuration options which can be changed from within the `index.php`. If there's an option you'd like available that isn't yet implemented, feel free to submit an issue with the label enhancement.

Bugs/Missing Features
=====================
If you find a bug in this software, please fill out an issue ticket in this project's issue tracker. If you're a developer and you'd rather have a more hands on approach, please fill out a ticket, fork the repo, and submit a pull request when the issue ticket has been completed.

Have fun and happy pranking!
